I have made a basic shell named aSh!!

It can handle the following commands: cd, quit, echo, pwd, ls, cat, mkdir, rm and date.

I have implemented the 5 external commands using fork() and exec() family of commands.

For most of the commands, i've handled the errors when they : 1. Are receiving invalid arguments
                                                              2. Not enough arguments
                                                              3. System call has been unsuccessful

Using this basic layout, we can extend the functionalities of our shell however much we want, thus, this can be used as a good starting point if you want to try out making your own shell
and even add your custom functions.

The folder can be compiled and run using the command "make".

Few of the test cases which can be used for testing:
For echo: try - echo hello world ; echo "hello world" ; echo "\n hello world \n" etc
For cd: try - cd .. ; cd /home ; cd ../.. ; cd ; etc
For quit: type quit
For pwd: type pwd anywhere;
For ls: try - ls ; chande directory and then do ls etc
For cat: try cat main.c 
For mkdir: try - mkdir hello; mkdir hello (again, would give error) 
For rm: try - rm <any file name>
For date: try date
