# Shell-in-C [aSh]

> A basic shell named aSh made using C language.

aSh can handle the following commands: cd, quit, echo, pwd, ls, cat, mkdir, rm and date. This is a very basic level shell and can be used as a template to make 
a custom shell with extended and custom functionalities :)

Please refer to Docs.txt for further details.

Tu run, just clone this repository, enter the folder and type:

You can quit the shell anytime by using "quit" command.

**Note:** If some commands are not running and showing the error "permission denied", just run the same command in aSh using "sudo" as prefix
[e.g. sudo ls]
